                <p class="figure-analysis">This graph presents the IMDb ratings for the top three movies in each genre, highlighting the
                    highest-rated films across various categories. It shows that the top-rated movies generally have
                    high IMDb ratings, typically above 8.0, regardless of genre. Certain genres, such as Documentary,
                    stand out with near-perfect ratings, while other genres like Comedy or Horror show slightly more
                    variability. </p>

                <p class="figure-analysis">This bubble plot visualizes the distribution of movies by genre and runtime
                    range. The size of each bubble represents the number of movies within each combination. Higher
                    concentration of medium-runtime movies across most genres, especially Drama and Comedy. Long-runtime
                    movies are less frequent and primarily seen in genres like War and History, while short-runtime
                    movies have a more uniform but smaller representation across genres. This suggests that
                    medium-runtime films dominate the industry, regardless of genre, while specific genres may lend
                    themselves to longer or shorter runtimes.</p>

                <p class="figure-analysis">
                    This scatter plot illustrates the relationship between movie budget and revenue, categorized by
                    genre (color) and IMDb rating (point size). Higher-budget movies usually generate higher revenue,
                    but there are exceptions where some perform poorly (e.g., "The Flash"). Low-budget films tend to
                    cluster at lower revenue levels, though some achieve higher ratings, suggesting that audience
                    reception isn't exclusively tied to budget.

                <p class="figure-analysis">How to use this graph:</p>
                <ul class="figure-list">
                    <li>Hover Over Points: Interactive tooltips provide details about individual movies, including
                        title, genre, budget, revenue, and IMDb rating.</li>
                    <li>Adjust Filters: Use the budget filter to focus on specific subsets of the data.</li>
                    <li>Compare Genres: Look at color distributions.</li>

                <p class="figure-title"></p><strong>Figure 4:</strong> IMDB Rating adjusted by Budget Range. </p>
                Low Budget: 5 Million and less, Medium Budget: 50 Million to 5 Million, High Budget: 200 Million to 50
                Million</p>
                <p class="figure-analysis">This multi-box plot shows the distribution of IMDb ratings across movies categorized by budget range.
                    The median IMDb rating remains relatively consistent across all budget categories, suggesting that
                    budget size alone may not be a strong determinant of audience ratings. Still, movies in the Low
                    budget category have a wider range of ratings, with more extreme outliers on both the lower and
                    upper ends, while High-budget films show slightly higher consistency and fewer low outliers. This
                    indicates that while higher budgets may lead to more consistent quality, exceptional low-budget
                    movies can achieve high ratings.
