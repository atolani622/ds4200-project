            <h2>Summary</h2>

Fantasy, Science Fiction, and Adventure dominate in terms of average budgets and revenues, while genres like Comedy and Documentary thrive with lower budgets. Top-rated movies across all genres consistently maintain high IMDb ratings, showing that audience reception is not confined to specific genres or budget levels.</p>
