            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Our team’s passion for movies inspired us to explore the movie dataset. We’re particularly interested in analyzing the business side while also digging into how ratings and genres play a role. It’s an exciting way for us to combine our love for cinema with meaningful data insights. Our analysis focuses on exploring how movie ratings vary by budget, revenue, length, and genre. Specifically, we’re looking for relationships between financial performance and audience reception.</p>
